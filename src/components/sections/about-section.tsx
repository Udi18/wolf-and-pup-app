                Wolf & Pup was born from a simple idea: create a space where everyone in the community could feel at
                home, regardless of age or species.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded in 2020 by coffee enthusiasts and community advocates, we set out to build more than just a
                coffee shop. We wanted to create a hub where people could work, families could gather, and pets could
                playâ€”all under one roof.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Wolf & Pup stands as a testament to our commitment to quality coffee, community connection, and
                inclusive spaces. We&apos;re proud to be your neighborhood&apos;s living room.
